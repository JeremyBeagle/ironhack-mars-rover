# Ironhack: Mars Rover Assignment

## Description
This program simulates a lunar rover's movement over a 10 x 10 grid. The position of the rover is identified by an "R" in the grid. The grid contains at least five randomly placed obstacles that the rover cannot traverse. The user interacts with the rover by entering a series of commands at the prompt and pressing the enter key.

### Commands

f = "forward": advances the rover forward by one space in the rover's current direction.

b = "backward": advances the rover backward by one space in the rover's current direction.

r = "right": adjusts the rover's orientation 90 degrees clockwise.

l = "left": adjusts the rover's orientation 90 degrees counterclockwise.
